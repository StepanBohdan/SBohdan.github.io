									<span class="text">6. Question: What’s the difference between “skilled” and “unskilled” medical care?</span>
								</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="accrodion-content">
								<p><span>Answer:</span> "Unskilled" or "Non-medical" care ris often refers to companion and personal care exercises, for example, washing, prepping, bathing, dressing, as well as help with dinner arrangement, light housekeeping, and even running errands. It could likewise include medicine updates, help with ambulation, and transportation to medical arrangements. These types of services are typically provided by Home Health Aides (HHAs) or Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), and can be masterminded anywhere from a few hours to 24-hours a day. "Unskilled" or "Non-medical" care is often sought by the elderly, new and expectant parents, individuals with disabilities, and those transitioning from a hospital or medical facility to home.</p>
								<p>“Skilled” medical care follows a particular plan of care under the supervision of a Physician, Nurse, or Therapist, and includes home healthcare services such as nursing care; physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapies; as well as social services and hospice care. Skilled medical care in the home can help provide a comforting solution to residing in a hospital, nursing home, or assisted living community.</p>

									<span class="text">7. Question: Why should I hire NextGen to care for my loved one rather than finding a caregiver on my own?</span>
								</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="accrodion-content">
								<p><span>Answer:</span> Contracting a caregiver can often turn into a confusing and disappointing procedure. With the majority of the decisions that are accessible, it is imperative to know about some difficulties that may emerge if you procure a caregiver on your own. With our group of experienced and humane healthcare experts, we endeavor to guarantee that your particular needs are met. What's more, NextGen is pleased to be perceived nationally as a leading provider of quality home healthcare. Infact, our homecare workplaces are licensed by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) for both our private obligation nursing and affirmed home healthcare programs. We urge you to learn more about the steps are involved in hiring a caregiver on your own, and how choosing Maxim will allow you to focus on feeling happy and healthy, while we take care of the rest.</p>

									<span class="text">8. Question: Can I Change Schedule if I have any Appointment to keep?</span>
								</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="accrodion-content">
								<p><span>Answer:</span> Schedule changes are easily accomplished with as little as one week notice. Our philosophy is to make the schedule work for the family, not the agency. You, your needs, your requests as well as your schedule comes first. We will do everything possible to make sure the schedule you want is the schedule you get.</p>

									<span class="text">9. Question: Do you provide services in assisted living facilities?</span>
								</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="accrodion-content">
								<p><span>Answer:</span> Yes. Most people sometimes discover that the assistance provided in an assisted living facility is not sufficient to enable them to remain independent. In these cases, NextGen provides a qualified caregiver to make this possible. In some states you are allowed to hire private help in an assisted living facility-or nursing home.</p>
